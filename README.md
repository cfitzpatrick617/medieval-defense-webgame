<h1>Medieval Wave Defence: The Wiki</h1>

Medieval Wave Defence is a modern reboot of the classic Carnival Shooter game in which you shoot enemies to defend your castle.

<h2>How to Play</h2>

Your aim is to survive **five waves** which each last **30 seconds**. Each wave consists of a collection of random enemies chosen from 3 classes. Each wave gets more and more difficult as the game progresses.

Enemies will spawn on either the **ground** or the **castle walls** and will attempt to move from one side of the screen to another. If successful, you will lose a set amount of health. If all health is depleted, then you have lost and the game is over. At the start of each wave you start with **9 hearts**.

Your aim is simple - shoot and kill these enemies by **aiming with your mouse** and pressing **left-click** to fire. Be careful though, your bow only holds a **limited number of arrows**. Once all of your arrows run out you will be prompted to take a few seconds to **reload**.

After each wave, you will have the opportunity to purchase **useful upgrades** for future waves. Only one upgrade can be purchased at a time. Any upgrades purchased will **remain active for the rest of the game**.

Picking which enemies to target, when to reload and which upgrades to purchase are important choices that can affect the outcome of each game. Good luck!


<h2>Enemy Types</h2>

There are **three** enemy types.
 
1. **Serf**: the Serf is the most common and least dangerous enemy. They deal **one damage**, have **one health point** but move the fastest of all enemy types taking only **seven seconds** to reach the end.

2. **Chainmail**:  these are the middleground between the three enemy types, they are all-rounders who are dangerous if left unchecked. They deal **two damage**, have **two health points** but move at a decent speed taking **eight seconds** to reach the end.

3. **Knight**: The most dangerous enemy in the game. They are clad in thick plate armour and have a deadly weapon, they are the largest threat to the player. They deal **three damage**, have **three health points** but move at the slowest speed taking **nine seconds** to reach the end.
